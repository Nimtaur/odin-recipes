        <h2>Jesse Szewczyk's Pumpkin Pie with Maple Mascarpone Swirl</h2>
        <p>Cookbook author, writer, and food stylist Jesse Szewczyk was 
        inspired by the classic combination of pumpkin and cream cheese for 
        his riff. But instead of using actual cream cheese in this recipe, 
        he opted for mascarpone because it's "a tad sweeter and has a luscious, 
        dairy-forward flavor." The addition of maple syrup also adds just a 
        touch of caramel-like flavor. "It's a simple addition that takes 
        traditional pumpkin pie to a whole new level, adding a complex, 
        autumnal flavor," Szewczyk writes.</p>
