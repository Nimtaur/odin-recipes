        <p>Every November, Americans debate the merits of canned cranberry sauce vs. fresh cranberry sauce. The canned sauce, with its signature shape and jiggly texture, is certainly nostalgic. Fresh sauce, meanwhile, usually has a more complex flavor (and a less gelatinous texture). Plus, when you make cranberry sauce from scratch, you're able to customize the ingredients and ratios to suit your taste.

            Whether you're Team Can or a fan of the homemade stuff, we think you should give this fresh cranberry sauce a try. you definitely won't be disappointed!
